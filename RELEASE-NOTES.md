## Release Notes :

#### 1.0.6

Files to be uploaded are renamed prior to upload. This is to avoid an issue with file name overlapping in AIP Console.

#### 1.0.5 :

Minor release with changes to the Java package in the CLI and Core lib.
Updates to the documentation.

Added an example for the Jenkins Plugin use in a Jenkins Pipeline Job

#### 1.0.4 : 

âš  Default request timeout is now 90s. This is to avoid errors when uploading very large files (over 1GB). 

Fix :
* An error with the message `UploadException: No more content to read, but file not complete (the file might be modified by another program?).` occured for evry large file. This was due to an integer overflow that has been fixed.
* Updated library `com.fasterxml.jackson.core` libraries to version 2.9.10, to fix a vulnerability (see https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14540 and https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16335)

#### 1.0.3:

Aligning version with CAST Extend version.
 
Additions : Connection Timeout, Rescan, Application Name in Add Version, Automatically create a new application if the give name doesn't exist, Ignore Failures

CLI:
* With the `AddVersion` sub command, you can specify the application name (with `-n`) instead of having to provide an application guid
* With the `AddVersion` sub command, you can specify `--auto-create` to create a new application on the target AIP Console instance if it doesn't exists
* You can specify a timeout (in seconds) for each sub commands, in case your AIP Console instance takes some time to answer.

Jenkins Plugin:
* In the Add Version build step, you have to specify an application name, instead of the application GUID.
* In the Add Version build step, you can check the "auto create" checkbox to have AIP Console plugin automatically create the application in AIP Console instance.
* In the Add Version build step, you can check "Rescan" to automate the delivery and analysis of your application. This will create a new version, based on the previously delivered one, and keep the same configuration.
* In the Add Version build step, you can check "Ignore Failures" to avoid having the plugin fail the job. Instead, the plugin will mark its execution has being unstable if any issue occurs.

*Note : Application GUID will still appear in the build step, but it is a read only value, meant for verification (and backwards compatibility)*
