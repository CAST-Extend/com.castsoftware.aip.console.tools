## AIP Console Tools Jenkins Plugin

This Jenkins Plugin for AIP Console allows users to automate application source code delivery and analysis directly within their CI systems. Most elements that can be configured through the AIP Console UI can also be configured when using this plugin in your build configurations.

### Pre-Requisites

This plugin requires the following :

* a Jenkins installation ()
* An installation of AIP Console 2.X (or higher) that is accessible and configured.
* A means of Authentication using :
  * For Enterprise installations, an API Token for the user that will run the CLI (
    check [here for details on obtaining a token](https://doc.castsoftware.com/display/AIPCONSOLE/AIP+Console+-+User+Profile+options))
  * For AIP Console Standalone, a username and password. Check the `Authentication with username (AIP Console Standalone)` section in Other Topics, towards the end of this document.
* The ability to generate an archive for your source code OR a configured location in AIP Console where your source will be stored/updated.

### Regarding Jenkins Versions

This plugin is built targeting Jenkins version Jenkins 2.361.4 (or higher). This means that it is the bare minimum version required to install this plugin. **However**, because this plugin depends on other components that have been moved from being Jenkins components to being Plugins not included in the Jenkins directly, but rather installed through the Plugins Manager of Jenkins. Therefore, installing AIP Console Tools Jenkins Plugin might also download dependencies like Pipeline Steps.

The Plugins Manager of Jenkins requires access to a dedicated site (https://updates.jenkins.io/), which provides lists of plugins and their dependencies for Jenkins. However, it limits the numbers of supported Jenkins releases on a regular basis. As of 19/01/2024, the oldest compatible version is 2.375.1 (LTS) and 2.377 (Weekly). This means that the installation of plugins would only be possible on these versions if you are using the default update site. For older versions, you would have to set up a custom update sites tailored to your version of Jenkins, though updating to a newer one would be preferable, to correct issues and CVEs.

Note that the latest compatible LTS would change regularly, as new LTS releases are available for Jenkins.

### Installation (and Update)

To start using AIP Console Jenkins Plugin, you must first install the plugin in Jenkins.

To do this, you must go to Manage Plugins page of your Jenkins Server.

<img src="doc/images/manage_plugins_menu_item.png" alt="manage plugin page location" style="zoom:50%;" />

Then, in the "Advanced" tab, under "Upload Plugin", click "Browse" and select the `aip-console-jenkins.hpi` file.

Click on Upload and Jenkins should install the plugin.

**Updating the plugin is the same process**, but it might require to restart your Jenkins server after installation for the changes to take effect.

### Configuration

To configure the AIP Console plugin, go to the "Configure System" page in the "Manage Jenkins" page.

<img src="doc/images/configure_system_menu_item.png" alt="global configuration page location" style="zoom:50%;" />

On this page, go to the **AIP Console global configuration** section and enter the following required elements :

* *AIP Console URL* : The URL to access the AIP Console server. Make sure that this address is accessible from the
  Jenkins Server and the Jenkins Node that might run the plugin as well.
* *API Key* : The API key that will be used to authenticate to AIP Console.
* *Timeout* : A global timeout setting in seconds before calls to AIP Console will be considered in error.
* *verbose* : When checked, the AIP Console logs will also be displayed on the build's log. Uncheck this to prevent displaying the entirety of the AIP Console job execution to be displayed during the build.

![Global configuration page](./doc/images/global_config_page.png)

### Using different AIP Console URL and API Key

Should you require to target a specific AIP Node instance that differs from the global configuration in Jenkins, you can specify the URL and an API Key by opening the "Advanced Settings" options. Note that you will have to manually set them for each build steps that require targeting a specific AIP Console Instance.

![Step specific AIP Console URL and API Key configuration](./doc/images/custom_URL_ApiKey.png)

The AIP Console URL and associated API Key specified in the step details will always be used when running a step. In case they are left empty, the global configuration will be used instead.

## Quick Start

The following section will focus on running a job, with the basic required parameters. For more details on each options, please refer to each steps in [Advanced Usage](#advanced_usage)

#### Create Application

To create an application, add the `Create application on AIP Console` Step to a job.

![Menu item to add the create application step](doc/images/create_app_menu.png)

In that build step :
* you *must* provide the application name.
* You can decide whether the application should keep the delivered version history or not.

Running this step will create the application and initialize the underlying systems in AIP Console.

<u>Important note</u>
* When an application is created without the delivery history then the source code should be located in the Source
  Folder Path sub-folders. This meant no file will not be accepted.
  
#### Add Version

![Menu item to add the add version step](doc/images/add_version_menu.png)

The `Add Application Version to AIP Console` will create a new version of an application, run an analysis and create a
snapshot of that analysis.
  
This step requires the following :

* An application name for which a new version will be created. <u>This application must exist in AIP Console</u>.
* A path to a zip or tgz archive file to upload (**NOTE**: you can also provide a folder path; more details in the Advanced Usage Section below).

This step will perform the following actions :

* Upload the file `source.zip` to application `my app`
* Create a new version with an automatically generated name
* Run an analysis on this version
* Create a snapshot

This version and the snapshot can be found in the Application's page in AIP Console.

#### Deliver

The `Deliver Source Code to AIP Console` step is similar to the Add version step above.

![deliver_sources_menu](doc/images/deliver_sources_menu.png)

It requires the following :

* An application name for which a new version will be created. <u>This application must exist in AIP Console</u>.
* A path to a zip or tgz archive file to upload (**NOTE**: you can also provide a folder path; more details in the
  Advanced Usage Section below).
* Whether the version should be current or not

This step will perform the following actions :

* Upload the file `source.zip` to application `my app`
* Create a new version with an automatically generated name

The version will be created and visible inside the `Versions` tab of the application in AIP Console.

#### Analyze

The step `Analyze Application on AIP Console` will only run an Application Analysis on AIP Console.

It only <u>requires an Application Name</u>.

However, note that you <u>need at least one Delivered version on AIP Console</u> for this step to work correctly.

This step will perform the following actions :

* Get the latest version
* Start an analysis on that version

![analyze_application_menu](doc/images/analyze_application_menu.png)

#### Snapshot

The step `Create Snapshot on AIP Console` will create a snapshot for an Application on AIP Console.

It only <u>requires an Application Name</u>.

However, note that you need to have run an Analysis on the Current version for the target Application.

This step will perform the following actions :

* Create a Snapshot
* Generate Snapshot Indicators
* Publish snapshot
* Optionally decided whether to publish the application to the Health Dashboard or not.

The Snapshot can then be found inside the `Snapshot` tab in AIP Console.

![create_snapshot_menu](doc/images/create_snapshot_menu.png)

#### Architecture Studio Model Checker

![Menu item to add the model checker step](doc/images/arch_studio_model_checker.png)

The `Architecture Studio Model Checker` will check the application against a model.

This step requires the following :

* An application name against which the model will be checked. <u>This application must exist in AIP Console</u>.
* A model name which is the name of the architecture model.
* A report path location where the report will be downloaded.
* An upload path with filename where the architecture model is located(only required when the architecture model against which the application needs to be checked is not already present in the AIP console).

This step will perform the following actions :

* Upload the file `filename.CASTArchitect` to architecture studio in AIP Console(if file path is provided).
* Checks the application against the provided model.
* Downloads the report in the provided report path

#### Upgrade

![Menu item to add the upgrade step](doc/images/upgrade_build_steps.png)

The `Upgrade Application` will upgrade the application.

This step requires the following :

* An application name of the application which needs to be upgraded. <u>This application must exist in AIP Console</u>.

This step will perform the following actions :

* Upgrade the application to the available node version

#### Resync

![Menu item to add the resync step](doc/images/resync_build_steps.png)

The `Resync Application` will sync the application.

This step requires the following :

* An application name of the application which needs to be resynced. <u>This application must exist in AIP Console</u>.

This step will perform the following actions :

* Sync the application on the AIP Console

#### Onboard Application

Creates an application or uses an existing application to manage source code using a modern on-boarding workflow in CAST
Imaging Console.

This command is used to perform the *Fast scan* or to *refresh* the sources contents before optionally perform a *Deep
Analysis* (run the
analysis).

- To perform *Fast Scan/New Scan* operation do select *Console Onboard Application Fast-Scan* step
- To perform *Deep Scan/Run Analysis* operation do select *Console Onboard Application Deep-Analysis* step

**build step**

## Advanced Usage

This section will provide a detailed look at each parameter available for each type of jobs.

### A Note on variable expansion

Variable expansion means replacing some variables in text fields to an environment variable value.

For example, creating an application with name "${JOB_NAME} (jenkins)", the Plugin will replace '${JOB_NAME}' with the
name of the current running job.
You can use these environment variables on the following fields in each jobs (when defined):

* Application name
* Version name
* Snapshot name
* Domain Name
* Source File Path
* Model Name
* Report Path
* Upload File Path
* Security dataflow

You can manually add environment variables to a build or use global jenkins environment variables (see [the jenkins documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#using-environment-variables))

## Other Topics

#### Authentication with username (AIP Console Standalone)

**This section only applies to AIP Console Standalone**

In AIP Console Standalone, authentication doesn't use an API Key as it is not handled by the authentication mechanism.
Instead, you will have to use username/password combo to interact with AIP Console Standalone.

To do this, go to the **Configure System** page of Jenkins, under **AIP Console GLobal Configuration**, click on the
Advanced Settings button.

You should see a Username field. Enter the username there and the password in the API Key field.

Authentication will then be done using this username/password combo.

#### Issues and Logging

If you are facing issues with the AIP Console Jenkins Plugin, you can provide more details to CAST Support or in a Github Ticket by adding a Logger to the Console plugin.

To do this, go to **Manage Jenkins** page and then **System Log**

Click on "Add new log recorder" and provide a unique name. Click Save.

Then click on the Add button in Logger.

Specify `com.castsoftware.aip.console.tools`. Click again on Add and now specify `io.jenkins.plugins.aipconsole`

Click Save.

Go back to the **System Log** page and click on the Log Name you defined previously.

Next time you run a Build using the AIP Console Jenkins Plugin, log messages of all levels should appear here.

#### Pipeline Scripts

Every steps defined above mcan be used in a Pipeline Job or using a Jenkinsfile.

Rather than detail every step here, you can quickly generate the required syntax using the integrated "Pipeline Syntax" command in Jenkins, to generate a snippet based on a selected step and associated parameters.

![Example of generating a pipeline snippet from deliver step parameters](doc/images/pipeline_syntax_example.png)

You can access this "Pipeline Syntax" page by opening an existing Pipeline job, and click on the "Pipeline SYntax" menu item (left side column)

![Pipeline Syntax menu item in the left side column in a pipeline job page](doc/images/pipeline_syntax_menu_item.png)

#### Pipeline Sample

Here is an example Pipeline Script :

```groovy
node {
  // Stages to display on the build page
  stage('Preparation') {
    // Get some code from a GitHub repository
    checkout changelog: false, poll: false, scm: [$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: '*/master']], extensions: [[$class: 'RelativeTargetDirectory', relativeTargetDir: 'sources']], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/jglick/simple-maven-project-with-tests.git']]]
  }
  stage('Build') {
    dir('sources') {
      sh "git archive -o ../source.zip HEAD"
    }
    aipAddVersion applicationName: 'my jenkins pipeline app', autoCreate: true, cssServerName: '', domainName: '', filePath: 'source.zip'
  }
}
```

This basic pipeline performs the following :
* Initializes a 'Preparation' stage, a visual separator for the different sections of the build
* In this stage, it will retrieve source code using Git from the url to a subdirectory called "sources"
* Initialzes a 'Build' stage
* In this stage:
  * It will move to the "sources" folder where the source was checked out.
  * Inside the "sources" folder, the build will call `git archive` to create an archive from the local git repository and save it to the file `source.zip` which it will store in the parent directory
  * Moving back to the parent folder, the build will call `Add Version`, providing an application name, with auto create (`Create application if missing`) set to true and point to the created source.zip file

![Stages of the build defined in the pipeline](doc/images/pipeline_build_stages.png)

When running the build, it'll display the progess of each stages visually and show the time to run each stages.

This can be used in existing Jenkinsfile or new pipeline jobs, to be included in your existing CI workflow.

A more complex example can be found in [the examples folder's README file](examples/README.md)
